<div class="paragraph" > This whole concept began when my roommate argued that pineappple on pizza was something that only crazy people ate. <br> He could not be more wrong. <br> Pineapple on pizza is one of God's greatest gifts to mankind, and we are all blessed by its existence. <br> Furthermore, pineapple pizza that has been chilled in the fridge overnight is delicious beyond belief. The pineapple becomes sweeter, and the cheese underneath becomes a beautiful little shell to cradle the chunks of fruit. It is truly a a masterpiece that only the simpleminded and foolish would dismiss. <br> I have lost friendships and family members to this misinformation spread on social media. This is why I have created this website dedicated to the greatest food ever created -except Meditteranian dishes. <br> I will begin a campaign of pineapple loving people that spread the good word until the whole world knows of its taste. </div>
